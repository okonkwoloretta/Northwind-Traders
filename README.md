## Introduction:

Sales and order analysis is the process of collecting, analyzing, and interpreting data about sales and orders to identify trends and patterns. This data can be used to make better decisions about pricing, product development, marketing, and sales operations.
However, it can also involve more complex statistical methods. Either way, the goal is to gain insights that will help boost sales.

## Benefits of sales and order analysis:

## metrics used in sales and order analysis:

I would like to analyze the sales and order dataset for the fictitious gourmet food supplier company Northwind Traders, which was created by [Maven Analytics](https://mavenanalytics.io/data-playground). 
The dataset contains information on customers, products, orders, shippers, and employees. I would like to use this data to identify trends in sales, customer behavior, and product popularity. 
This information could be used to improve the company's sales and marketing strategies.

## Steps involved to ensure good analysis: 

* Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:

This involves identifying and correcting any errors in the data, removing any duplicate or irrelevant data, and transforming the data into a format that is easy to analyze.

   -	Checking for Null and Duplicates
